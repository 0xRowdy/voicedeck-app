            We prioritize the authenticity of each report. Recognizing that
            local residents have the most accurate insights into matters
            affecting their own region, we want to give the power back to them.
            Using an advanced cryptographic developer tool known as Anon
            Aadhaar, we use Aadhaarâ€™s QR code to verify an individual's
            citizenship without revealing any information about them. For
            further details, you can read more here.
